# A* (A-star) Algorithm for Graph Path finding

The A* algorithm is a fundamental path finding algorithm used in our TSP solution. It efficiently finds the optimal path between any two nodes in a graph, making it essential for calculating accurate distances between client locations in the road network.

## Core Purpose

In our TSP solution, A\* serves two critical functions:

1. Finding shortest paths between any two points in the road network
2. Contributing to the generation of accurate distance matrices for TSP solving

## Input Requirements

1. **Graph Structure (Road Network)**:
   - Adjacency matrix representation
   - Travel costs between locations
   - Connection indicators
   - Valid numerical values

2. **Location Indices**:
   - Starting location identifier
   - Destination location identifier
   - Valid network references

3. **Heuristic Function**:
   - Distance estimation logic
   - Admissible calculation method
   - Consistent evaluation approach

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Heuristic Function h(n)

The heuristic component estimates remaining distance to the goal using:

- Direct distance calculations
- City-block measurements
- Geographic distance formulas
- Custom estimation methods

### 2. Cost Function g(n)

Tracks actual travel costs through:

- Real road distance measurements
- Accumulated path distances
- Travel time calculations
- Road type considerations

### 3. Evaluation Function f(n)

Combines actual and estimated costs:

- Total cost calculation: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
- Path evaluation metrics
- Route optimization logic

## Output Format

1. **Path Information**:
   - Ordered location sequence
   - Complete route description
   - Navigation waypoints
   - Empty result for impossible routes

2. **Cost Details**:
   - Total route distance
   - Accumulated travel costs
   - Segment breakdowns
   - Invalid path indicators
